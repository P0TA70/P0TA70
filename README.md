## Hello!

I am currently a 2nd year in a CSE course.
I do codeforces sometimes, and also have a few dev projects. I like working in Qt/Qml (you won't find any projects here since I didn't completely finish any for a public repo), and Flutter. I do html/js sometimes.

On my repos you'll find some dotfiles, and completely random projects written in those.
